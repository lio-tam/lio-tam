# 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Lio Tam**, a Computer Engineering student at RWTH Aachen University in Germany 🇩🇪  

Previously trained in medicine (pre-clinical stage), I have a strong passion for human medicine andhealth science, and I’ve later developed a strong interest in **using digital solutions for human medicine**.

I enjoy building things that connect the physical and digital world – especially where low-level programming meets meaningful user interaction.
