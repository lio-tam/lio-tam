# 👋 Hi there!

I'm **Chi Fung Lio Tam**, a Computer Engineering student at RWTH Aachen University in Germany 🇩🇪  
Previously trained in medicine (pre-clinical stage), I’ve developed a strong passion for **embedded systems**, **human-centered technology**, and **digital health innovation**.

I enjoy building things that connect the physical and digital world – especially where low-level programming meets meaningful user interaction.
